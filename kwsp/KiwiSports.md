# Kiwi Sports
 
 
## Downloads  
- Golf beta1 (7/10/20): [https://bit.ly/KiwiSportsB1](https://bit.ly/KiwiSportsB1)  
  - Removed erroneous river environment sound effects from Hole 6's course info.
  - Kiwi Sports now includes my Pause Anywhere code, you can pause at any time in any sport (really makes golf runs less taxing)
  
Please note that Kiwi Sports is in very early development;  
This release is purposed as a golf-beta, there are more features that will be added in golf, however this is a good baseline 9-hole support release.
Things like menus aren't fully changed, and there are no other important modifications outside of golf.  

## Usage  
To install this mod, simply extract the main ZIP file, and copy all of the folders inside it to the root of your SD card.  
  
A copy of Riivolution is included with the download, along with the codehandler, so that if you have never even heard of Riivolution before, you will not need to install anything yourself.
