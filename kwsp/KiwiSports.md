# Kiwi Sports
 
 
## Downloads  
- Golf beta1 (7/10/20): [https://bit.ly/KiwiSportsB1](https://bit.ly/KiwiSportsB1)  
  - Removed erroneous river environment sound effects from Hole 6's course info.
  - Included Gecko codes:
    - Unlimited Wii Fitness tests! Train to your heart's content!
    - All training games unlocked from the start! (This is important because Kiwi Sports needs its own save file.)
    - Pause anywhere, anytime! You are now no longer unable to pause during certain actions in sports. You can even *pause in Wii Fitness* now, and can choose `Start over` if the current Wii Fitness minigame isn't going well, or `Quit` to exit the fitness test.
  
  
Please note that Kiwi Sports is in very early development;  
This release is purposed as a golf-beta, there are more features that will be added in golf, however this is a good baseline 9-hole support release.
Things like menus aren't fully changed, and there are no other important modifications outside of golf.  

## Usage  
To install this mod, simply extract the main ZIP file, and copy all of the folders inside it to the root of your SD card.  
  
A copy of Riivolution is included with the download, along with the codehandler, so that if you have never even heard of Riivolution before, you will not need to install anything yourself.
